// A note about implementing PWA features with Vite: Vite automatically hands entry points and output configurations based on project structure so these do not have to be defined explicitly as with webpack
// Vite automatically injects bundles into the HTML file, so HTMLWebpackPlugin is not needed.
// I'm bundling my custom service worker directly with Vite using a custom build plugin, instead of using Workbox's InjectManifest feature. My service worker will thus be directly included in the final build output as service-worker.js.
// PWA manifest creation is handled by Vite PWA plugin which generates the web app manifest based on the configuration provided here and does not require WebpackPwaManifest plugin as for Webpack.
// CSS and Babel Loaders are also made redundant by the fact that Vite handles CSS and JavaScript modules natively. Vite provides built-in support for CSS and JavaScript files are processed using ESBuild, which supports ES6/next gen features.
